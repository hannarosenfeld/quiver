        answer='According to our current understanding of physics, nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in a vacuum. This is known as the universal speed limit. However, there are some phenomena that can appear to exceed the speed of light, such as certain particles that can travel faster than light through a medium like water or air, but they still do not exceed the speed of light in a vacuum.',

                Start with a list of veggies you like, then check to make sure you have the correct soil conditions, planting zone, and rainfall.
                Next, read up on the requirements of each plant. Can they be grown together in the same bed? Under one another, or do they need full sun? Are there good companion plants?
                Last, plan out your beds, and then track their progress with a good journal. Of course I recommend my book, (see link under my name) since I put so much work and years of experience into its development. I compared all the others out there for 15 years, and then designed the 28 different logs to include all the most logical information, in the easiest way to record.

        answer='''A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer. The machine code is usually in the form of assembly code or object code, which can be executed directly by the computer's central processing unit (CPU). Compilers are used to create executable programs, libraries and other software components from source code.''',

        answer='''Protein source always come with either carbs or fat or both. So you should select protein sources depending you want low carb protein food or low fat protein food or protein food with both carb and dietary fat.

The first one low carb is generally animal source protein - meat, egg, chicken, fish, cheese, Panneer, milk and yogurt/curd. Second one low fat is plant source - legumes, pulses, potato skin, apricot, guava and few green vegetables. The Third one medium carb and medium fat is also plant source - Nuts and seeds like Almonds, Pista, Walnuts and even peanuts. The plant source proteins are also good source of fibre.

Plant source food is of very low density of protein compared to animal source. You need to eat plenty of carbs to get enough protein as desired by you. For most people who are not into body building, plant sources are sufficient. If you desire to have more than 30â€“50gm of protein, animal source is the way to to go or supplements such as whey protein.''',

        answer='There are many herbs that are easy to grow at home, but some of the most popular and easiest to care for include basil, cilantro, mint, parsley, chives, and thyme. These herbs can be grown in pots or in a small garden bed, and they require little maintenance. They also add flavor and nutrition to your cooking. If you are new to gardening, I recommend starting with one of these herbs and then expanding your collection as you gain more experience.',

        answer='A medieval village typically consisted of small, thatched-roof houses made of wattle and daub (a mixture of mud, clay, and straw). These houses were often grouped together around a central green or common area. The village would have also had a church or chapel, and possibly a manor house or castle belonging to the local lord or noble. There would have been small plots of land for growing crops and raising animals, as well as a mill for grinding grain. The village would have been surrounded by a wooden or stone wall to protect against raiders. Overall, a medieval village would have been a self-sufficient community, with residents working together to farm, trade and defend their land.',
